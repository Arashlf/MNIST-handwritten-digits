# MNIST handwritten digits

## MNIST dataset:
MNIST is a collection of handwritten digits from 0-9. 
Image of size 28 X 28

## Introduction
MNIST contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits: 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. The images are grayscale, 28x28 pixels, and centered to reduce preprocessing and get started quicker.
